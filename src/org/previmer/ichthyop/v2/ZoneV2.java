 * This class defines a geographical area used by the program to locate

 * whether any grid point belongs to the Zone.
 * </p>
 *
 * The geographical area is defined as followed :
 * Four geodesics demarcation points {lon, lat} P1, P2, P3 & P4 and
 * two depths depth1 & depth2.
 * <p>
 * Longitude is expressed in East degree and latitude in North degree.
 * Depths are positive Integers.
 * </p>
 * The area is first delimited by the polygon (P1 P2 P3 P4).
 * The points dont have to be in the water, but make sure they belong to the
 * geographical grid of the simulation.
 * The four demarcation points P1(plon1, plat1) to P4(plon4, plat4) must be
 * recorded in the clockwise or anticlockwise direction.
 * Then, another routine isolates the area of the polygone that is contained
 * between the bathymetric lines depth1 & depth2.
 * At last the user can choose the color
 * (Red[0, 255], Green[0, 255], Blue[0, 255]) of the area.

     * Determines whether the specified grid point (x, y) belongs to the zone.
     * It first ensures the grid point (x, y) is inside the polygon
     * (P1 P2 P3 P4) and then checks whether (x, y) is in between bathymetric
     * line depth1 and depth2.
     *
     * <p>
     * The algorithm to determine whether a point (X0, Y0) is inside a polygon
     * has been adapted from a function in ROMS/UCLA code, originally written by
     * Alexander F. Shchepetkin and Hernan G. Arango. Please find below an
     * extract of the ROMS/UCLA documention.
     * </p>
     * <pre>
     * Given the vectors Xb and Yb of size Nb, defining the coordinates
     * of a closed polygon,  this function find if the point (Xo,Yo) is
     * inside the polygon.  If the point  (Xo,Yo)  falls exactly on the
     * boundary of the polygon, it still considered inside.
     * This algorithm does not rely on the setting of  Xb(Nb)=Xb(1) and
     * Yb(Nb)=Yb(1).  Instead, it assumes that the last closing segment
     * is (Xb(Nb),Yb(Nb)) --> (Xb(1),Yb(1)).
     *
     * Reference:
     * Reid, C., 1969: A long way from Euclid. Oceanography EMR,
     * page 174.
     *
     * Algorithm:
     *
     * The decision whether the point is  inside or outside the polygon
     * is done by counting the number of crossings from the ray (Xo,Yo)
     * to (Xo,-infinity), hereafter called meridian, by the boundary of
     * the polygon.  In this counting procedure,  a crossing is counted
     * as +2 if the crossing happens from "left to right" or -2 if from
     * "right to left". If the counting adds up to zero, then the point
     * is outside.  Otherwise,  it is either inside or on the boundary.
     *
     * This routine is a modified version of the Reid (1969) algorithm,
     * where all crossings were counted as positive and the decision is
     * made  based on  whether the  number of crossings is even or odd.
     * This new algorithm may produce different results  in cases where
     * Xo accidentally coinsides with one of the (Xb(k),k=1:Nb) points.
     * In this case, the crossing is counted here as +1 or -1 depending
     * of the sign of (Xb(k+1)-Xb(k)).  Crossings  are  not  counted if
     * Xo=Xb(k)=Xb(k+1).  Therefore, if Xo=Xb(k0) and Yo>Yb(k0), and if
     * Xb(k0-1) < Xb(k0) < Xb(k0+1),  the crossing is counted twice but
     * with weight +1 (for segments with k=k0-1 and k=k0). Similarly if
     * Xb(k0-1) > Xb(k0) > Xb(k0+1), the crossing is counted twice with
     * weight -1 each time.  If,  on the other hand,  the meridian only
     * touches the boundary, that is, for example, Xb(k0-1) < Xb(k0)=Xo
     * and Xb(k0+1) < Xb(k0)=Xo, then the crossing is counted as +1 for
     * segment k=k0-1 and -1 for segment k=k0, resulting in no crossing.
     *
     * Note 1: (Explanation of the logical condition)
     *
     * Suppose  that there exist two points  (x1,y1)=(Xb(k),Yb(k))  and
     * (x2,y2)=(Xb(k+1),Yb(k+1)),  such that,  either (x1 < Xo < x2) or
     * (x1 > Xo > x2).  Therefore, meridian x=Xo intersects the segment
     * (x1,y1) -> (x2,x2) and the ordinate of the point of intersection
     * is:
     *                y1*(x2-Xo) + y2*(Xo-x1)
     *            y = -----------------------
     *                         x2-x1
     * The mathematical statement that point  (Xo,Yo)  either coinsides
     * with the point of intersection or lies to the north (Yo>=y) from
     * it is, therefore, equivalent to the statement:
     *
     *      Yo*(x2-x1) >= y1*(x2-Xo) + y2*(Xo-x1),   if   x2-x1 > 0
     * or
     *      Yo*(x2-x1) <= y1*(x2-Xo) + y2*(Xo-x1),   if   x2-x1 < 0
     *
     * which, after noting that  Yo*(x2-x1) = Yo*(x2-Xo + Xo-x1) may be
     * rewritten as:
     *
     *      (Yo-y1)*(x2-Xo) + (Yo-y2)*(Xo-x1) >= 0,   if   x2-x1 > 0
     * or
     *      (Yo-y1)*(x2-Xo) + (Yo-y2)*(Xo-x1) <= 0,   if   x2-x1 < 0
     *
     * and both versions can be merged into  essentially  the condition
     * that (Yo-y1)*(x2-Xo)+(Yo-y2)*(Xo-x1) has the same sign as x2-x1.
     * That is, the product of these two must be positive or zero.
