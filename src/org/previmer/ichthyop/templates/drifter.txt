# Ichthyop - Drifter initial coordinates
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

# (Character '#' at the begining of a line means "comment", the line is not interprated by the application)#

#
## Howto ? ##
#

# one line = one drifter
#
# 3D simulation #
# position of the drifter is defined by three coordinates:
# longitude latitude depth
# eg: -4.62 48.38 -10
#  Use 'dot' (and no 'coma') for decimal numbers
#  longitude unit [East degree]
#  latitude unit [North degree]
#  depth unit [meter], depth > 0 will be interpreted in the application as (-1 * depth)
#  if depth is not defined, application assumes that depth = 0
#  coordinates are separated by a space

# 2D simulation #
# position of the drifter is defined by two coordinates:
# longitude latitude
# eg: -4.62 48.38
# same norm for longitude and latitude than 3D simulation.

#
# TIP #
#

# You can use drifter file for 3D simulation with 2D simulation.
# Indeed the application will ignore the depth for 2D simulation.

#
## Example ##
#

-4.62 48.38 -10
-4.62 48.38 -10.5
-4.72 48.38 -20
-4.62 47.38 -10
