 * Ichthyop is a free Java tool designed to study the effects of physical and
 * biological factors on ichthyoplankton dynamics. It incorporates the most
 * important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth,
 * mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity,
 * temperature and salinity fields archived from oceanic models such as NEMO,
 * ROMS, MARS or SYMPHONIE. It runs with a user-friendly graphic interface and
 * generates output files that can be post-processed easily using graphic and
 * statistical software.

/**
 * This class simulates active swimming, given the swimming velocity as an age
 * function. The swimming velocity is provided in a semicolon separated CSV
 * file, with two columns the age of the particle in days and the corresponding
 * swimming velocity in metres per second. The swimming velocity in the CSV file
 * can be interpreted as CRUISING velocity or MAXIMAL velocity. CRUISING means
 * that the particle will swim at the exact velocity defined in the CSV file.
 * MAXIMAL means that the particle will swim at random velocity ranging from
 * zero to the velocity defined in the CSV file.
