 * Ichthyop is a free Java tool designed to study the effects of physical and
 * biological factors on ichthyoplankton dynamics. It incorporates the most
 * important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth,
 * mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity,
 * temperature and salinity fields archived from oceanic models such as NEMO,
 * ROMS, MARS or SYMPHONIE. It runs with a user-friendly graphic interface and
 * generates output files that can be post-processed easily using graphic and
 * statistical software.
