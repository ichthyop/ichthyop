 * Ichthyop is a free Java tool designed to study the effects of physical and
 * biological factors on ichthyoplankton dynamics. It incorporates the most
 * important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth,
 * mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity,
 * temperature and salinity fields archived from oceanic models such as NEMO,
 * ROMS, MARS or SYMPHONIE. It runs with a user-friendly graphic interface and
 * generates output files that can be post-processed easily using graphic and
 * statistical software.

     * Advects the particle with the model velocity vector, using a Forward
     * Euler scheme. Let's see how it works with the example of the Zonal
     * component.
     * <pre>
     * ROMS and MARS uses an Arakawa C grid.
     * Here is the scheme (2D) of cells (i, j) and (i + 1, j):
     *
     *     +-----V(i, j)-----+---V(i + 1, j)---+
     *     |                 |                 |
     *     |            *X   |                 |
     * U(i - 1, j)  +      U(i, j)    +     U(i + 1, j)
     *     |                 |                 |
     *     |                 |                 |
     *     +---V(i, j - 1)---+-V(i + 1, j - 1)-+
     *
     * Particle current location: X(x, y, z)
     * Let's take i = round(x), j = truncate(y) and k = truncate(z)
     * dx = x - i, dy = y - j, dz = z - k
     * Let's call t, the current time of the simulation, and t0 and t1 the
     * values of the time NetCDF variable bounding t: t0 <= t < t1
     * We first interpolate the model velocity field at t0:
     * U(t0) = U(t0, i, j, k) * |(0.5 - dx) * (1 - dy) * (1 - dz)|
     *       + U(t0, i, j, k + 1) * |(0.5 - dx) * (1 - dy) * dz|
     *       + U(t0, i, j + 1, k) * |(0.5 - dx) * dy * (1 - dz)|
     *       + U(t0, i, j + 1, k + 1) * |(0.5 - dx) * dy * dz|
     *       + U(t0, i + 1, j, k) * |(0.5 + dx) * (1 - dy) * (1 - dz)|
     *       + U(t0, i + 1, j, k + 1) * |(0.5 + dx) * (1 - dy) * dz|
     *       + U(t0, i + 1, j + 1, k) * |(0.5 + dx) * dy * (1 - dz)|
     *       + U(t0, i + 1, j + 1, k + 1) * |(0.5 + dx) * dy * dz|
     *
     * This large expression can be written:
     *
     * U(t0) = U(t0, i + ii, j + jj, k + kk)
     *         * |(0.5 - ii - dx) * (1 - jj - dy) * (1 - kk - dz)|
     *
     * with ii, jj and kk integers varying from zero to one.
     * U is expressed in meter per second and we would like to express the move
     * in grid unit. Therefore it has to be adimensionalized.
     * Let's call Ua the velocity in grid unit per second
     * Let's take dXI(i, j) the length of the cell in the zonal direction.
     *
     * Ua(t0) = U(t0, i + ii, j + jj, k + kk)
     *          / [dXI(i + ii , j + jj) + dXI(i + ii + 1, j + jj)]
     *          * |(0.5 - ii - dx) * (1 - jj - dy) * (1 - kk - dz)|
     *
     * Same with U(t1).
     * Let's take frac = (t - t0) / (t1 - t0)
     * Then Ua(t) = (1 - frac) * Ua(t0) + frac * Ua(t1)
     *
     * x(t + dt) = x(t) + Ua(t) * dt
     * </pre>
