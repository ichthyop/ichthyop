# Ichthyop is a free Java tool designed to study the effects of physical and
# biological factors on ichthyoplankton dynamics. It incorporates the most
# important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth,
# mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity,
# temperature and salinity fields archived from oceanic models such as NEMO,
# ROMS, MARS or SYMPHONIE. It runs with a user-friendly graphic interface and
# generates output files that can be post-processed easily using graphic and
# statistical software.
