#

# A wind scenario is defined as a serie of patterns
# (it may actually be a single pattern, which means wind is constant for the whole simulation).
# A pattern is always defined by the same set of parameters.
# Each parameter must be defined for every pattern, even though the value does not vary.
# For instance, you may have a constant wind direction (North) and a varying intensity.
# Every pattern will re-defined the wind direction as being North.
# Here is the full set of parameters:

# pattern [n]
# wind.intensity[n] = 15.6
# wind.direction[n] = 90.0
# windage[n] = 3.5
# from.time[n] = year 2008 month 01 day 07 at 18:00

# wind intensity [meter / second] decimal number
# wind direction [angle in degree] a decimal number ranging from 0 to 359
#    0 = Northward (wind blows toward North)
#   90 = Eastward (wind blows toward East)
#  180 = Southward (wind blows toward South)
#  270 = Westward (wind blows toward West)
#  Carefull, the adopted convention (oceanography) is opposite to the meteorology convention.
#  Indeed, the wheatherman considers the direction where the wind comes from,
#  whereas we consider where it is heading.
# windage is a percent (decimal number ranging from 0.0 to 100.0) that expresses how much is the particle affected by the wind.
#  eg: wind blowing Northward 10m/s windage = 1% ==> particle drift Northward 0.1m/s
#  Effectively, the windage for an immersed object, windage will never exceed a few percent.
# from.time [year #### month ## day ## at HH:mm]
#  The start time for this set of parameter.
#  Make sure we always have from.time[n] < from.time[n + 1]
#  There is no end.time parameter so the last set of parameter will be active until the end of the simulation
#  If you want to have wind blowing for a few days and then no more wind,
#  a last pattern has to be defined with wind.intensity = 0 or windage = 0, for instance.

#
## Example ##
#

# pattern [0]
wind.intensity[0] = 10
wind.direction[0] = 135
windage[0] = 3
from.time[0] = year 01 month 05 day 05 at 00:00

# pattern [1]
wind.intensity[1] = 15
wind.direction[1] = 0
windage[1] = 3
from.time[1] = year 01 month 05 day 08 at 00:00

# pattern [2]
wind.intensity[2] = 0
wind.direction[2] = 0
windage[2] = 0
from.time[2] = year 01 month 05 day 12 at 00:00
