# Release schedule

In Ichthyop, there is the possibility to schedule release events. These events are parameterized in the `release.schedule` option block.

It mainly contains two parameters:

- `is_enabled` specifies whether release events schedule is activated or not
- `events` is list of release date strings, which are formatted as the beginning simulation parameter (`year YYYY month MM day DD at YY:MM`).

The resulting output file will contain the same number of time-steps as in the case of a simple release, but the number of particles will be
multiplied by the number of release events.

The output time array will be consistent with the beginning simulation time (`initial_time` parameter), **not with the release schedule dates**.
