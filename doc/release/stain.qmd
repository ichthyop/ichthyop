## Stain release

The release stain (`StainRelease.java`) consits of releasing particles within a given circle. The user provides the longitude and latitudes of the release stain, the radius of the release stain (in $m$) and the number of particles to release.

For a 3D simulation, the user also provides the depth and the thickness of the release stains (both in $m$).

An example of a stain release is provided in @fig-stain-release
