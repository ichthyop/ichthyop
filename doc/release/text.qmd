## Text release

If the user wants to simulate some specific trajectories, for instance DCPs or buoys, particles can be relased
by providing a text file containing the release coordinates (`TxtFileRelease.java`). The name of the text file is
given by the `txtfile` parameter.

The file must be formatted as follows:

```
# 3D simulations
# longitude latitude depth
-5.45 48.30 -5
-5.45 48.30 -10
-5.45 48.30 -15
-5.45 48.30 -20
```

Each line is a drifter. Each character starting with `#` is considered as a comment.
If the depth column is not provided, depth will be set equal to 0.

For 2D simulations, the depth column will be ignored.

Note that the columns must be separated by spaces.
