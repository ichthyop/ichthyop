Adding output variable
============================================

When including new processes to Ichthyop (cf. :numref:`new_action`), the storage of additional variable may be required. 
For instance, in the growth processes  (see :numref:`growth-proc`), in which particle length is a state variable, it is necessary to
save length in the output NetCDF file. This is done by creating a new Java class associated with
a property file. 

Creating java class
==========================

Creating the Java class depends on what type of variable you want to save, as shown 
in :numref:`fig_output_diag`.

General case
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Adding new variables can be achieved by creating new tracker class in the ``org.previmer.ichthyop.io`` package, which inherits
from the ``AbstractTracker`` java class. It must override the 4 methods, as shown below for the ``LengthTracker`` class:

.. code:: java
    
    public class LengthTracker extends AbstractTracker {

        @Override
        public void setDimensions() { 
        }
        
        @Override
        public void addRuntimeAttributes() { 
        }
        
        @Override
        public Array createArray() { 
        }
                
        @Override
        public void track() { 
        }
    
    }
    
``setDimensions`` defines the dimensions associated with the variable. Time and drifter dimensions must be added by
using the ``addTimeDimension()`` and ``addDrifterDimension()`` methods, respectively. A zone dimension can be added by
calling the ``addZoneDimension(TypeZone zoneType)`` method. Custom dimensions can be added by using the 
``addCustomDimension(Dimension dim)`` method.

``addRuntimeAttributes`` defines additional attributes associated with the variable to be saved. Attributes are 
added by calling the ``addAttribute(Attribute attribute)`` method. 

.. note:: 
    
    Compulsory attributes and variable names 
    are defined using properties files, see :numref:`tracker_prop`

``createArray`` initializes the ``Array`` object that will be used to store the output variable.
The dimensions of the array depends on the dimension of the output variables. 

``track()`` is the method that is called at each output time-step and which writes the variable in the NetCDF.

Simple case
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Usually, new variables consist in tracking one single particle property, such as length for instance. In this case, the new
tracker class can inherits either from the ``FloatTracker`` or the ``IntegerTracker`` classes as follows:

.. code:: java
    
    public class LengthTracker extends FloatTracker {

        @Override
        float getValue(IParticle particle) {
            ...
        }
    }
    
In this case, the only method to define is the ``getValue(IParticle particle)``, which specifies which particle's 
state variable is to be extracted for the given tracker.
    
.. _tracker_prop:


Creating property file
==========================

In addition to the tracker java class, a property file must be included in the ``io/resources/`` folder. The name of this 
file must me the same as the Java class, except for the `.properties` suffix. For instance, the property file associated 
with the ``LengthTracker.java`` class will be named ``LengthTracker.properties``. It must contain the following three lines:

.. code:: bash
    
    tracker.shortname = length
    tracker.longname = particle length
    tracker.unit = millimeter

``tracker.shortname`` is the name of the variable in the NetCDF, ``tracker.longname`` and ``tracker.unit`` are the values of the 
variable's longname and unit attributes.
