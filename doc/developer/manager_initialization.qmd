## Manager initialization

When an Ichthyop simulation is launched, managers are mobilized in the following order (cf. `SimulationManager.mobiliseManagers()` method):

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-align: center
%%| fig-cap: "Order in which managers are mobilized."
%%| label: fig-managers
graph TD;

    id0("Dataset Manager")
    id1("Release Manager")
    id2("Time Manager");
    id3("Action Manager");
    id4("Zone Manager");
    id5("Output Manager");

    classDef className fill:lightblue,stroke:black,stroke-width:3px,color:black

    id0 --> id1
    id1 --> id2
    id2 --> id3
    id3 --> id4
    id4 --> id5
```

This order is the one in which the managers will be setup and then initialized.

During the setup process, the `setupPerformed` methods, implemented on all the manager classes, will be called.

After this setup process, the managers will be initialized. This will be achieved by calling
the `initializePerformed` methods,  implemented on all the manager classes.
