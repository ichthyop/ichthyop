Manager initialization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When an Ichthyop simulation is launched, managers are mobilized in the following order:

.. mermaid:: _static/mermaid/setup.md
    :caption: Order in which managers are mobilized.
    :align: center

This order is the one in which the managers will be setup and then initialized.

During the setup process, the ``setupPerformed`` methods, implemented on all the manager classes, will be called. 

After this setup process, the managers will be initialized. This will be achieved by calling the ``initializePerformed`` methods,  implemented on all the manager classes.
