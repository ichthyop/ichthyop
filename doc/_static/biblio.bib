  abstract = {Larval reef fish possess considerable swimming and sensory abilities, which could enable navigation towards settlement habitat from the open ocean. Due to their small size and relatively low survival, tagging individual larvae is not a viable option, but numerical modeling studies have proven useful for understanding the role of orientation throughout ontogeny. Here we combined the theoretical framework of the biased correlated random walk model with a very high resolution three-dimensional coupled biophysical model to investigate the role of orientation behavior in fish larvae. Virtual larvae of the bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) were released daily during their peak spawning period from two locations in the Florida Keys Reef Tract, a region of complex eddy fields bounded by the strong Florida Current. The larvae began orientation behavior either before or during flexion, and only larvae that were within a given maximum detection distance from the reef were allowed to orient. They were subjected to ontogenetic vertical migration, increased their swimming speed during ontogeny, and settled on reefs within a flexible window of 24 to 32 days of pelagic duration. Early orientation, as well as a large maximum detection distance, increased settlement, implying that the early use of large-scale cues increases survival. Orientation behavior also increased the number of larvae that settled near their home reef, providing evidence that orientation is a mechanism driving self-recruitment. This study demonstrates that despite the low swimming abilities of the earliest larval stages, orientation during this ``critical period'' would have remarkable demographic consequences.},

abstract = {Individual-based coupled physical-biological models have become the standard tool for studying ichthyoplankton dynamics and assessing fish recruitment. Here, common sole (Solea solea L.), a flatfish of high commercial importance in Europe was used to evaluate transport of eggs and larvae and investigate the connectivity between spawning and nursery areas along the western Iberian coast as spatio-temporal variability in dispersal and recruitment patterns can result in very strong or weak year-classes causing large fluctuations in stock size. A three-dimensional particle tracking model coupled to Regional Ocean Modelling System model was used to investigate variability of sole larvae dispersal along the western Iberian coast over a five-year period (2004–2009). A sensitivity analysis evaluating: (1) the importance of diel vertical migrations of larvae and (2) the size of designated recruitment areas was performed. Results suggested that connectivity patterns of sole larvae dispersal and their spatio-temporal variability are influenced by the configuration of the coast with its topographical structures and thus the suitable recruitment area available as well as the wind-driven mesoscale circulation along the Iberian coast.}

It incorporates the most important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth, mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity, temperature and salinity fields archived from ROMS or MARS oceanic models. It runs with a user-friendly graphic interface and generates output files that can be post-processed easily using graphic and statistical software.}
