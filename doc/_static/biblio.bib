abstract = {Individual-based coupled physical-biological models have become the standard tool for studying ichthyoplankton dynamics and assessing fish recruitment. Here, common sole (Solea solea L.), a flatfish of high commercial importance in Europe was used to evaluate transport of eggs and larvae and investigate the connectivity between spawning and nursery areas along the western Iberian coast as spatio-temporal variability in dispersal and recruitment patterns can result in very strong or weak year-classes causing large fluctuations in stock size. A three-dimensional particle tracking model coupled to Regional Ocean Modelling System model was used to investigate variability of sole larvae dispersal along the western Iberian coast over a five-year period (2004–2009). A sensitivity analysis evaluating: (1) the importance of diel vertical migrations of larvae and (2) the size of designated recruitment areas was performed. Results suggested that connectivity patterns of sole larvae dispersal and their spatio-temporal variability are influenced by the configuration of the coast with its topographical structures and thus the suitable recruitment area available as well as the wind-driven mesoscale circulation along the Iberian coast.}

abstract = {Ichthyop is a free Java tool designed to study the effects of physical and biological factors on ichthyoplankton dynamics. It incorporates the most important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth, mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity, temperature and salinity fields archived from ROMS or MARS oceanic models. It runs with a user-friendly graphic interface and generates output files that can be post-processed easily using graphic and statistical software.}
