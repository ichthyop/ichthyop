## Growth {#sec-growth-proc}

There is 2 different implementations of the growth module. They can be selected by setting the
`class_name` parameter in the `action.growth` action configuration block.

### Linear growth

To use the linear growth method described in @LETT20081210, choose the `LinearGrowthAction.java` class.

Length increment is provided as follows:

$$
\Delta L = C_1 + C_2 \times \dfrac{F}{F + K_S} \times max(T, T_{thres}) \times \Delta t
$$

where $\Delta t$ is the time-step (in days), $C_1$ and $C_2$ are parameters (`coeff1` and `coeff2`), $T_{thres}$ is a temperature threshold (`threshold_temp` parameter), $F$ is the food quantity and $K_S$ is
a half-saturation constant (`half_saturation` parameter). If the latter is not defined or equals 0, $Q$ is assumed to be $1$.

The name of the food and temperature variables are provided by the `food_field` and `temperature_field` parameters.

<!-- TODO Add the description of the DEB module -->


### Sole growth

If the {samp}`SoleGrowthAction.java` class is selected, the growth model used in {cite}`TANNER201778` is
used. It relies on the growth equation from {cite}`fonds1979laboratory` and given by:

$$
\Delta L = C_1 \times T^{C_2} \times \Delta t
$$

with $L$ the length, $T$ the temperature and $\Delta t$ the time step in days, and $C_1$ and $C_2$ are parameters (`c1` and `c2` respectively).

The temperature field is provided by the `temperature_field` parameter.
