## Random swimming

Ichthyop allows particles to randomly swim. This is achieved by using the
`SwimmingAction.java`. The velocity may vary with the age of the particle.

The user provides a CSV absolute velocity file (`velocity_file` parameter), which must me formatted as follows:

```
Age (days);Speed (m/s)
0;0.1
5;0.2
15;0.3
```

The user also provides a boolean parameter (`constant_velocity`) that specifies whether the velocity should remain as defined in the CSV file,
or if the absolute velocity should be randomly selected as follows:

$$
\|U\| = \|U\|_{file} \times \kappa
$$

with $\kappa$ a random value in the $[0, 2]$ interval and $\|U\|_{file}$ the velocity defined in the CSV file.

At each time-step, the zonal and meridonal velocities are defined as follows:

$$
U = \kappa' \varepsilon  \|U\|
$$

$$
V = \varepsilon' \sqrt{\|U\|^2 - U^2}
$$

with $\kappa'$ a random value between 0 and 1, and
$\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon'$ random values either equal
to 1 or -1.
