## Coastal behaviour


### Bouncing

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
import os
import subprocess

cwd = os.getcwd()
fpath = "process/_static/plot_bouncing.py"
subprocess.call(["python", fpath], stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)

```

In the bouncing mode, the particle will bounce on the coast. First, whether the bouncing occurs on a meridional or a zonal coastline is determined.

In case of a meridional coastline, as shown in @fig-bouncing, the calculation of the new position is performed as follows.

Let's assume that the particle is at the position $(x, y)$ and is moved at the postion $(x + \Delta x, y + \Delta y)$. We suppose that

$$
\Delta y = \Delta y_1  + \Delta y_2,
$$ {#eq-bounc_1}

where $\Delta y_1$ is the meridional distance between the particle and the coastline, and $\Delta y_2$ is the distance that the particle will spend on land.

In the bouncing mode, the position increment can be written as

$$
\Delta_{cor} y = \Delta y_1 - \Delta y_2
$$ {#eq-bounc_2}

By replacing $\Delta y_2$ using @eq-bounc_1, we can write:

$$
\Delta_{cor} y = \Delta y_1 - (\Delta y - \Delta y_1)
$$

$$
\Delta_{cor} y = 2 \Delta y_1 - \Delta y
$$
