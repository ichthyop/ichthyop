Daily vertical migration
#############################

The ``MigrationAction.java`` manages the daily migration of the particles. It is done by providing daytime and nighttime depths, and the timing of the sunset and sunrise. 

If the ``daytime_depth_file`` parameter is defined, it provides the depth of the particle during daytime. It is formatted as follows:

.. code:: bash

    Age (day);Depth (m)
    0.0;-20
    3.0;-25
    5.0;-30
    8.0;-35

If this parameter is not found, a constant daytime depth, provided by the ``daytime_depth`` parameter, is assumed.

Same thing for the nighttime depths, which can be set by either the ``nighttime_depth_file`` or the ``nighttime_depth`` parameters.

The sunset and sunrise hours are set by the ``sunset`` and ``sunrise`` parameters, which must have a ``HH::mm`` format.

If the growth module is deactivated, the user must provide the minimum age (in days) at which the particle starts to migrate (``age_min`` parameter). If the growth module is activated, it manages the activation or deactivation of the daily migration. 

.. warning::

    When the target depth is greater than the total depth, the particle does not move.
