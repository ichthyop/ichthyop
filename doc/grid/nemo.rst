In this section, the main features of the NEMO grid and the implications in Ichthyop are summarized.

Horizontal
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Computation domain
+++++++++++++++++++

In the NEMO grid, the computation domain extends from the western edge of the western T cell (`i=0`) to the eastern edge of the eastern T cells (`i=nx`), and from the 
southern edge of the southern T cells (`j=0`) to the northern edge of the nothern T cells (`j=ny`).


Indexing
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The horizontal layout of the NEMO grid is as follows:

.. image:: _static/nemo_hor_index.png
   :width: 250 px
   :align: center

Tracer points (``T`` points) are stored at the center of the cell. Zonal velocities (``U`` points) are stored on the eastern face, while meridional velocities (``V`` points) are stored on the northern face. **U, V and T points have the same number of elements!**

Scale factors
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In NEMO, the zonal and meridional length of the cells are stored in the ``e1x`` and ``e2x`` variables, with ``x`` equals to ``t``, ``u`` or ``v`` depending on the point considered.

Land-sea mask
++++++++++++++++

For a particle at a given location, we determine whether it is on land as follows:

- We extract the `i` index of the `T` land-sea mask to use by computing `round(x - 0.5)`.
- We extract the `j` index of the `T` land-sea mask to use by computing `round(y - 0.5)`.
- We extract the mask value at the `(i, j)` location.

Close to coast
++++++++++++++++++++++++

To determine whether a particle is close to coast, we extract the three neighbouring T cells. If one of them is land, then it assumed to be close to coast.

Is On Edge
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The particle is considered to be out of the domain if the `y` value is greater than `ny - 0.5` (no possible interpolation of `T` points) or less than `1` (no possible interpolation of `V` points).

If there is no zonal cyclicity, the particle is also considered to be out of the domain if the `x` value is greater than `nx - 0.5` (no possible interpolation of `T` points) or less than `1` (no possible interpolation of `U` points).

Zonal cyclicity
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For regional simulations, there is no zonal cyclicty. On the other hand, for global NEMO simulations, which runs 
on the ORCA grid, the zonal cyclicity is as follows (indexes are provided for T points):

   :align: center

Therefore:

- if :math:`x \leq 1`, the particle is moved at :math:`N_x - 2 + x`
- if :math:`x \geq nx - 1`, the particle is moved at :math:`x - N_x + 2)`

Interpolation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Interpolation of T variables
================================

Given a given position index of a particle with the `T` grid, the determination of the interpolation is done as follows:

- First, the `i` index of the `T` grid column left of the particle is found. This is done by using `floor` on the `x - 0.5` value. The removing of 0.5 is to convert the `x` value from the computational grid to the `T` grid.
- Then, the `j` index of the `T` grid line below the particle is found. This is done by using `floor` on the `y - 0.5` value. The removing of 0.5 is to convert the `y` value from the computational grid to the `T` grid.
- The area to consider is defined by the `[i, i + 1]` and `[j, j + 1]` squares.

An illustration is given below

   :align: center


Interpolation of U variables
================================

Interpolation of `U` variables is done as follows:

- First, the `i` index of the `U` point left of the particle is found by using `floor(x - 1)`. The `-1` is to move from the computation grid to the `U` grid system.
- Then, the `j` index of the `U` grid line below the particle is found. This is done by using `floor` on the `y - 0.5` value. The `-0.5` is to move from the computation grid to the `U` grid system.
- The box used to average the variable is therefore defined by the `[i, i + 1]` and `[j, j + 1]` squares.

Interpolation of V variables
================================

Interpolation of `V` variables is done as follows:

- First, the `i` index of the `V` point left of the particle is found by using `floor(x - 0.5)`. The `-0.5` is to move from the computation grid to the `U` grid system.
- Then, the `j` index of the `V` grid line below the particle is found. This is done by using `floor` on the `y - 1` value. The `-1` is to move from the computation grid to the `U` grid system.
- The box used to average the variable is therefore defined by the `[i, i + 1]` and `[j, j + 1]` squares.

Vertical
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Indexing
++++++++++++++++++++++

The original NEMO vertical indexing system is shown below:

.. image:: _static/nemo_ver_index.png
   :width: 250 px
   :align: center

Index starts at 0 (at the surface) and ends at :math:`N_z - 1` at depth. There are as many ``W`` levels as ``T`` levels. In NEMO, the ``T`` point situated at :math:`N_z - 1` **is always masked**. ``W`` levels are located *above* the corresponding ``T`` points.

Therefore, in Ichthyop, only the first :math:`N_z - 1` ``T`` points are read, while all the :math:`N_z` ``W`` points are read. This is show below:

   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

   Vertical indexing system as used in Ichthyop. Red dashed lines represent the ``W`` levels (cell edges), whose index is given in the gray box.

There is now :math:`N_z` W levels but :math:`N_z - 1` T levels.

Furthermore, since in Ichthyop the first index corresponds to the seabed, the arrays are vertically flipped. Consequently, the final structure of the vertical grid is as follows:
