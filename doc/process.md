# Ichthyop processes

In this section, the different Ichthyop processes are described. These processes are implemented in the classes within
the {samp}`action` folder.

Parameters associated with these processes must be included in {samp}`action` blocks. They can be activated or deactivated by setting the
`enabled` tag (cf. {numref}`xml-config`).
