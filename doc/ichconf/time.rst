Time configuration

Beginning of the simulation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Ichthyop, the user provides the time at which the simulation should start. This ``initial_time`` parameter, which must be 
defined in an ``option`` block, must be formatted as ``year YYYY month MM day DD at HH:MM``, with ``YYYY`` the year, ``MM`` the
month, ``DD`` the day, ``HH`` the hour and ``MM`` the minutes where the simulation should start.

Reading NetCDF times
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When reading a NetCDF file (ocean currents, temperature, wind, wave, etc.), Ichthyop will determine the units in which NetCDF time is stored.
These units must meet the `CF Metadata Conventions <https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.7/build/ch04s04.html>`_ 
and therefore be provided as follows:

.. code:: bash
    
    UNITS since YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
    
with ``UNITS`` the units in which the time is stored (usually ``seconds``, ``days`` or ``hours``), ``YYYY`` the year, ``MM`` the month, ``DD`` the day, ``HH`` the hour, ``MM`` the minutes  and ``SS`` the seconds of the reference date.

If a NetCDF ``time::units`` attribute is defined, Ichthyop will try to infer the NetCDF reference date and time units using this convention.

If it fails (i.e. the ``time::units`` attribute does not follow the convention) or if no ``time::units`` attribute is found, 
Ichthyop will read the ``time_origin`` parameter, which must be defined following the CF conventions.

.. danger::
    
    When reading two datasets (an ocean currents dataset and a wind dataset for instance), if none meets the CF convention, Ichthyop
    will apply the units defined in the ``time_origin`` parameter to both datasets, even though they may have different time units. 
    **Therefeore, in this case, it is strongly recommended to manually include CF-like  time units attributes to each dataset (cf. below).**

Manually updating the ``units`` attribute can be done by using
the `ncatted <https://linux.die.net/man/1/ncatted>`_  command (**Linux users**):

.. code:: bash
    
    #!/bin/bash
    for file in *nc
    do 
        ncatted -O -a units,time,o,s,"seconds since 1900-01-01 00:00:00" $file
    done

This can also be done by using Python as follows:

.. code:: python
    
    from glob import glob
    import xarray as xr

    units = 'seconds since 1900-01-01 00:00:00'
    time = 'time'

    filelist = glob('*nc')

    for f in filelist:

        data = xr.open_dataset(f)
        data[time].attrs['units'] = units
        data[time]

        data.to_netcdf(f) 
        
.. note:: 
    
    The user must replace ``time`` by the name of the time variable which is used by Ichthyop. 
    Common values are ``time``, ``scrum_time``, ``time_counter``, ``ocean_time``.
    
    The units value must also be chosen consistently with the dataset
