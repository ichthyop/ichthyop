${licensePrefix}Ichthyop is a free Java tool designed to study the effects of physical and
${licensePrefix}biological factors on ichthyoplankton dynamics. It incorporates the most
${licensePrefix}important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth,
${licensePrefix}mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity,
${licensePrefix}temperature and salinity fields archived from oceanic models such as NEMO,
${licensePrefix}ROMS, MARS or SYMPHONIE. It runs with a user-friendly graphic interface and
${licensePrefix}generates output files that can be post-processed easily using graphic and
${licensePrefix}statistical software.
