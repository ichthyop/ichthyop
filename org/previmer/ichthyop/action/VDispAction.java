    /**
     * Simulates vertical dispersion.
     * We used the Random walk model thoroughly described by Andr√© W Visser
     * with reflecting boundary conditions.
     * The equation includes a random component and a non random advective
     * component from areas of low diffusivity to areas of high diffusivity.
     * This second term represents the gradient of diffusivity
     * and prevents form artificial accumlation of particles in areas of low
     * diffusivity.
     *
     * <p>
     * The equation requires the diffusivity K at any point z and the first
     * derivative of K at point z.
     * In paper North et all 2006, it is shown that a mere linear interpolation
     * of the diffusivity leads to artificial aggregation of particles where
     * abrupt changes in vertical diffusivity occured. She suggested to fit a
     * continuous function (tension spline) to a smoothed profile of vertical
     * diffusivities. In ROMS and MARS NetCDF dataset, the vertical diffusivity
     * has already been average in time so we decided to skip the preliminary
     * spatial smoothing of the diffusivity profile. Please see {@link #getKv}
     * for details about the computation of the diffusivity at any depth.
