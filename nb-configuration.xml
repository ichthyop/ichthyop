Ichthyop is a free Java tool designed to study the effects of physical and
biological factors on ichthyoplankton dynamics. It incorporates the most
important processes involved in fish early life: spawning, movement, growth,
mortality and recruitment. The tool uses as input time series of velocity,
temperature and salinity fields archived from oceanic models such as NEMO,
ROMS, MARS or SYMPHONIE. It runs with a user-friendly graphic interface and
generates output files that can be post-processed easily using graphic and
statistical software.
